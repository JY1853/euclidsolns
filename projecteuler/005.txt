Consider the numbers 1 through 20; we obviously need each prime number, hence:

1 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19

Next, we consider the largest numbers first to get the maximum number of each factor needed:

20 = 2 * 2 * 5
18 = 2 * 3 * 3
16 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2

Hence, we have:

2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232792560
